	abstract = {Plant diseases introduce significant yield and quality losses to the food production industry, worldwide. Early identification of an epidemic could lead to more effective management of the disease and potentially reduce yield loss and limit excessive input costs. Image processing and deep learning techniques have shown promising results in distinguishing healthy and infected plants at early stages. In this paper, the potential of four convolutional neural network models, including Xception, Residual Networks (ResNet)50, EfficientNetB4, and MobileNet, in the detection of rust disease on three commercially important field crops was evaluated. A dataset of 857 positive and 907 negative samples captured in the field and greenhouse environments were used. Training and testing of the algorithms were conducted using 70\% and 30\% of the data, respectively where the performance of different optimizers and learning rates were tested. Results indicated that EfficientNetB4 model was the most accurate model (average accuracy = 94.29\%) in the disease detection followed by ResNet50 (average accuracy = 93.52\%). Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer and learning rate of 0.001 outperformed all other corresponding hyperparameters. The findings from this study provide insights into the development of tools and gadgets useful in the automated detection of rust disease required for precision spraying.},

	abstract = {Rapid and accurate clinical diagnosis of pathological conditions remains highly challenging. A very important component of diagnosis tool development is the design of eﬀective classiﬁcation models with Mass spectrometry (MS) data. Some popular Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been investigated for this purpose but these ML models require time-consuming preprocessing steps such as baseline correction, denoising, and spectrum alignment to remove non-sample-related data artifacts. They also depend on the tedious extraction of handcrafted features, making them unsuitable for rapid analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been found to perform well under such circumstances since they can learn eﬃcient representations from raw data without the need for costly preprocessing. However, their eﬀectiveness drastically decreases when the number of available training samples is small, which is a common situation in medical applications. Transfer learning strategies extend an accurate representation model learnt usually on a large dataset containing many categories, to a smaller dataset with far fewer categories. In this study, we ﬁrst investigate transfer learning on a 1D-CNN we have designed to classify MS data, then we develop a new representation learning method when transfer learning is not powerful enough, as in cases of low-resolution or data heterogeneity. What we propose is to train the same model through several classiﬁcation tasks over various small datasets in order to accumulate generic knowledge of what MS data are, in the resulting representation. By using rat brain data as the initial training dataset, a representation learning approach can have a classiﬁcation accuracy exceeding 98\% for canine sarcoma cancer cells, human ovarian cancer serums, and pathogenic microorganism biotypes in 1D clinical datasets. We show for the ﬁrst time the use of cumulative representation learning using datasets generated in diﬀerent biological contexts, on diﬀerent organisms, in diﬀerent mass ranges, with diﬀerent MS ionization sources, and acquired by diﬀerent instruments at diﬀerent resolutions. Our approach thus proposes a promising strategy for improving MS data classiﬁcation accuracy when only small numbers of samples are available as a prospective cohort. The principles demonstrated in this work could even be beneﬁcial to other domains (astronomy, archaeology...) where training samples are scarce.},

	abstract = {Summary
In recent years, SWATH-MS has become the proteomic method of choice for data-independent–acquisition, as it enables high proteome coverage, accuracy and reproducibility. However, data analysis is convoluted and requires prior information and expert curation. Furthermore, as quantification is limited to a small set of peptides, potentially important biological information may be discarded. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to learn discriminative features directly from raw MS data, eliminating hence the need of elaborate data processing pipelines. Using transfer learning to overcome sample sparsity, we exploit a collection of publicly available deep learning models already trained for the task of natural image classification. These models are used to produce feature vectors from each mass spectrometry (MS) raw image, which are later used as input for a classifier trained to distinguish tumor from normal prostate biopsies. Although the deep learning models were originally trained for a completely different classification task and no additional fine-tuning is performed on them, we achieve a highly remarkable classification performance of 0.876 AUC. We investigate different types of image preprocessing and encoding. We also investigate whether the inclusion of the secondary MS2 spectra improves the classification performance. Throughout all tested models, we use standard protein expression vectors as gold standards. Even with our naïve implementation, our results suggest that the application of deep learning and transfer learning techniques might pave the way to the broader usage of raw mass spectrometry data in real-time diagnosis.

	abstract = {Opioid use disorder (OUD) is diagnosed using the qualitative criteria defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Diagnostic biomarkers for OUD do not currently exist. Our study focused on developing objective biological markers to differentiate chronic opiate users with OUD from chronic opiate users without OUD. Using biospecimens from the Golestan Cohort Study, we compared the metabolomics profiles of high opium users who were diagnosed as OUD positive with high opium users who were diagnosed as OUD negative. High opium use was defined as maximum weekly opium usage greater than or equal to the median usage (2.4 g per week), and OUD was defined as having 2 or more DSM-5 criteria in any 12-month period. Among the 218 high opium users in this study, 80 were diagnosed as OUD negative, while 138 were diagnosed as OUD positive. Seven hundred and twelve peaks differentiated high opium users diagnosed as OUD positive from high opium users diagnosed as OUD negative. Stepwise logistic regression modeling of subject characteristics data together with the 712 differentiating peaks revealed a signature that is 95\% predictive of an OUD positive diagnosis, a significant (p {\textless} 0.0001) improvement over a 63\% accurate prediction based on subject characteristic data for these samples. These results suggest that a metabolic profile can be used to predict an OUD positive diagnosis.},

Use of opiates has been associated with a variety of adverse complications such as neurological and behavioral outcomes, addiction, cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. While it is well known that opiates exert their neurobiological effects through binding with mu, kappa, and delta receptors to exert analgesic and sedative effects, mechanistic links to other health effects are not well understood. Our study focuses on the identification of biochemical perturbations in Golestan Cohort Study (GCS) opium users., Methods: We used untargeted metabolomics to evaluate the metabolic profiles of 218 opium users and 80 non-users participating in the GCS. Urine samples were obtained from adult (age 40–75) opium users living in the Golestan Province of Iran. Untargeted analysis of urine was conducted using a UPLC-Q-Exactive HFx Mass Spectrometry and a 700 MHz NMR Spectrometry., Results: These GCS opium users had a significantly higher intake of tobacco and alcohol and a significantly decreased BMI compared with non-users. Metabolites derived from opium (codeine, morphine, and related glucuronides), nicotine, and curing or combustion of plant material were increased in opium users compared with non-users. Endogenous compounds which differentiated the opium users and non-users largely included vitamins and co-factors, metabolites involved in neurotransmission, Kreb's cycle, purine metabolism, central carbon metabolism, histone modification, and acetylation., Conclusions: Our study reveals biochemical perturbations in GCS opium users that are important to the development of intervention strategies to mitigate against the development of adverse effects of substance abuse.},

	abstract = {The class activation maps are generated from the final convolutional layer of CNN. They can highlight discriminative object regions for the class of interest. These discovered object regions have been widely used for weakly-supervised tasks. However, due to the small spatial resolution of the final convolutional layer, such class activation maps often locate coarse regions of the target objects, limiting the performance of weakly-supervised tasks that need pixel-accurate object locations. Thus, we aim to generate more fine-grained object localization information from the class activation maps to locate the target objects more accurately. In this paper, by rethinking the relationships between the feature maps and their corresponding gradients, we propose a simple yet effective method, called LayerCAM. It can produce reliable class activation maps for different layers of CNN. This property enables us to collect object localization information from coarse (rough spatial localization) to fine (precise fine-grained details) levels. We further integrate them into a high-quality class activation map, where the object-related pixels can be better highlighted. To evaluate the quality of the class activation maps produced by LayerCAM, we apply them to weakly-supervised object localization and semantic segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that the class activation maps generated by our method are more effective and reliable than those by the existing attention methods.
