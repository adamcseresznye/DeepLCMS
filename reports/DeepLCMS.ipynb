    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional methods, DeepLCMS eliminates the need for extensive data processing, including peak alignment, data annotation, quantitation, and other time-consuming steps. Instead, it relies on the power of deep learning to directly classify mass spectrometry-based pseudo-images with high accuracy. To demonstrate the capabilities of pre-trained neural networks for high-resolution LC/MS data, we successfully apply our convolutional neural network (CNN) to categorize substance abuse cases. We utilize the openly available Golestan Cohort Study's metabolomics HRMS/LC data to train and evaluate our CNN [@pourshams_cohort_2010; @ghanbari_metabolomics_2021; @li_untargeted_2020]. We also delve into the network's decision-making process through TorchCam library. This tool allows us to gain insights into the factors that influence the network's classifications, helping us identify key compound classes that play a crucial role in differentiating between classes. By analyzing retention time and molecular weight, we can pinpoint areas of interest within the data.\n",

    "While computer vision has gained widespread adoption in various aspects of our lives[@dobson_birth_2023], its application in medical imaging and biosciences has lagged behind, primarily due to limitations in clinical dataset size, accessibility, privacy concerns, experimental complexity, and high acquisition costs. For such applications, transfer learning has emerged as a potential solution[@seddiki_towards_2020]. This technique is particularly effective with small datasets, requiring fewer computational resources while achieving good classification accuracy compared to models trained from scratch. Transfer learning involves a two-step process. Initially, a robust data representation is learned by training a model on a dataset comprising a vast amount of annotated data encompassing numerous categories (ImageNet for example). This representation is then utilized to construct a new model based on a smaller annotated dataset containing fewer categories. \n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the feasibility of our proof-of-concept demonstration, we selected a suitable dataset from the Metabolomics Workbench. We prioritized studies with distinct groups and a minimum sample size of 200. Additionally, we chose a dataset with a disk requirement of less than 50 GB to minimize computational resource demands. Based on these criteria, we identified the Golestan Cohort Study [@pourshams_cohort_2010]. This study, conducted in northeastern Iran, primarily investigates the risk factors for upper gastrointestinal cancers in this high-risk region. Approximately 50,000 volunteers were analyzed, including opium users and their mortality outcomes. Quantitative targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) data was collected at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [@ghanbari_metabolomics_2021; @li_untargeted_2020]. The dataset consisted of 218 opioid users and 80 non-users. After initial data inspection and conversion to mzML format using the ProteoWizard 3.0.22155 software, files were divided into training (n = 214), validation (n = 54), and test (n = 30) sets. To evaluate the impact of image characteristics and augmentation techniques on classification performance, four datasets were prepared. One dataset employed a bin size of 500 × 500 using the numpy library's histogram2d function and was named `ST001618_Opium_study_LC_MS_500`. Another dataset incorporated data augmentation using the augment_images function, generating nine additional images per training set with random offsets of up to 5 units in both x and y directions. This dataset was named `ST001618_Opium_study_LC_MS_500_augmented`. The third dataset employed a higher bin size of 1000 × 1000 using histogram2d for sharper pseudoimages and was named `ST001618_Opium_study_LC_MS_1000`. The final dataset applied the same augmentation technique to this dataset, generating nine additional images per training set with random offsets of up to 5 units in both x and y directions. It was named `ST001618_Opium_study_LC_MS_1000_augmented`.\n",

The function first loads the mass spectrometry data from the provided file path using the OpenMS library. A 2D histogram is created from the data, with the x-axis representing the retention time (RT) and the y-axis representing the m/z values. The intensity values of the histogram are normalized using the highest peak. To enhance the visualization of the data, a Gaussian filter is applied to reduce noise, and the filtered image is scaled to the range 0-255. The histogram is then logarithmically transformed to better visualize large ranges of data. The function then creates a plot of the histogram using matplotlib, with the colormap set to 'jet'. \n",

This comprehensive dataset and model structure contribute to their superior performance in this task. The dominance of the ConvNeXt family is noteworthy, suggesting their effectiveness in handling complex data such as mass spectrometry pseudoimages. Apple's MobileOne also demonstrated remarkable results (validation loss = 0.27), ranking fourth in terms of validation loss. Finally, MobileViT (validation loss = 0.27), a lightweight network, secured the seventh position.  \n",
    "Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that while the ConvNeXt model achieved the highest validation metrics, it is considerably larger and more parameter-intensive.

    "To further assess the suitability of these models and the consistency of their performance, we trained the top three performing models from each family five consecutive times and calculated the median and standard deviation of their validation metrics (@fig-exp-2-replicates_result). This approach allowed us to identify the models that exhibited the most consistent performance across multiple training runs. The results revealed that the MobileViT2 family consistently performed similarly to the ConvNeXt across all five training runs, except for the validation losses where ConvNeXt exhibited the lowest values with 0.21. According to the replication study, the ConvNeXt emerged as the most effective model, surpassing both MobileOne and MobileViT2. Despite exhibiting similar patterns, ConvNeXt exhibited a statistically significant advantage over MobileViT2 in validation loss (p = 0.01) and achieved significantly better validation recall (p < 0.05). Among the three models tested, MobileOne consistently underperformed its counterparts in all performance metrics, except for validation recall, where it narrowly outperformed MobileViT2 (p < 0.05).

A study object is created and the optimize method is invoked, specifying the number of trials. The core of Optuna's operation lies in its optimization process, which employs state-of-the-art algorithms to search the hyperparameter space efficiently. It also prunes unpromising trials to conserve computational resources. This is where Bayesian optimization plays a crucial role, guiding the search based on information from previous trials. The best hyperparameters found during the search can be obtained from the study object. Optuna also provides a real-time web dashboard for tracking the optimization process, allowing users to monitor the progress of the optimization and identify potential bottlenecks.  \n",

For the training, we utilized the augmented dataset (fig-exp-5-transformed_grid) that featured bin size set to 500 for both dimensions. To prevent overfitting and promote better generalization capabilities, random erasing was employed with a probability of 1, and color jitter was also utilized (probability=0.25).

This prevents the model from memorizing limited patterns in the training data and encourages it to generalize better to unseen data. The underlying concept resembles a dropout layer, a common component of neural network architectures.

These results translate to a precision of 0.952, recall 0.909, F1 0.930, and accuracy 0.90. While the model achieved impressive validation metrics, the slight drop in performance on the test set indicates a potential overfitting issue.

    "To gain insights into the regions of an image our model focuses on when making a prediction, we employed LayerCAM, a tool from the TorchCam package. LayerCAM (@jiang_layercam_2021), short for Layer Class Activation Maps, is a technique for generating class activation maps from distinct layers of a CNN. These regions of interests highlight the key features that the model utilizes to differentiate between opioid users and non-opioid users. Class activation maps are typically derived from the final convolutional layer of a CNN, highlighting discriminative object regions for the class of interest.

    "To gain a better understanding of the specific metabolic features that influence the model's decision-making process in classifying individuals into either group, we analyzed two examples of the pooled sample using MS-DIAL, an open-source software pipeline designed for data-independent MS/MS deconvolution and identification of small molecules. Subsequently, metabolite annotation was performed using the MSP database, which houses ESI-MS/MS fragmentation data for 16,481 unique authentic standards. Based on the MSP database, the level of compound identification was assigned as either 999, indicating that the feature extracted by MS-DIAL could not be identified, 530, signifying a tentative identification based solely on accurate mass matching against a database entry, or 430, indicating a definitive identification when the feature's fragmentation spectrum matched with the MS/MS spectrum of a database entry. \n",

This approach, in theory, should provide a deeper understanding of the features that play a crucial role in differentiating between the various classes."

Additionally, EDDP, a major metabolite of methadone, a synthetic opioid agonist used for chronic pain and opioid use disorder, is also considered by the model. While we observed tentative evidence suggesting that the metabolic pathways involving Kreb's cycle, purine metabolism, central carbon metabolism, histone modification, and acetylation are also considered by the model, as it was pointed out by @li_untargeted_2020, the level of identification (530) indicates that these associations are based solely on accurate mass measurement (@tbl-overlaid-identifications).

    "Although this is not the only approach to understanding the principles upon which the model bases its decisions, we believe that combining CNNs with MS/MS fragmentation-based untargeted metabolomics can be used as an example to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Conversely, the model can also guide researchers in directing resources and efforts towards identifying specific regions of interest more effectively by performing more targeted measurements, such as MS/MS experiments, since we already know which features play significant roles in distinguishing between the classes. We particularly recognize the potential benefits of such a model in high-throughput settings where rapid decisions are required, although thorough validation remains essential. This approach could be highly valuable in conjunction with techniques such as untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics, where an unbiased assessment of the phenotype is desirable, especially, when combined with simple sample preparation techniques such as protein precipitation. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the use of CNNs in high-throughput settings holds immense potential, it's crucial to acknowledge potential drawbacks. Further research is essential to comprehending how image preprocessing techniques influence the decision-making process. Currently, we've only implemented basic techniques, such as scaling, Gaussian noise reduction, and logarithmic transformation. The number of training examples could also pose a challenge. While transfer learning, as we demonstrated, doesn't demand a plethora of training examples, we still required over 200 images for training. Nonetheless, once we have a sufficient number of images for initial training, we can retrain the model as new data becomes available. Additionally, it's essential to exercise caution against overfitting. While we implemented strategies to mitigate overfitting and enhance generalizability, our testing metrics indicate a slight overfitting pattern compared to the validation metrics. However, employing cross-validation may help address this issue. Finally, GPU availability is crucial for neural network training. While transfer learning doesn't demand as much computational resources as training a network from scratch, utilizing a GPU is still recommended. Hence, having access to a GPU is highly advised. This project utilized the freely available GPU (NVIDIA Tesla T4) as part of the Google Colab. Once experimentation is complete, depending on the size of the model selected, inference may be able to be performed using a CPU.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This project serves as a proof-of-concept demonstrating the application of transfer learning in a binary classification task using untargeted LC/HRMS metabolomics data. We explored various CNN architectures and optimized hyperparameters, such as optimizer type and learning rate scheduler, to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, we utilized TorchCam to visualize the regions of the pseudoimage that the neural network focuses on for distinguishing between opioid users and non-users. Furthermore, we incorporated traditional techniques, including spectral deconvolution and MS/MS fragmentation pattern-based identification, to enhance our understanding of the CNN's decision-making process and guide researchers towards prioritizing relevant features. We hope this open-source project could serve as a valuable guideline for researchers seeking to develop CNN based applications following rigorous validation. We also envision a system, for example, where positive instances identified by the initial CNN could be further evaluated by a second network capable of estimating quantities using a regression model with mean squared error loss. Overall, this project aims to demonstrate the practical application of untargeted metabolomics data in combination with modern techniques such as computer vision and neural networks. We believe that the primary obstacle hindering the widespread adoption of metabolomics and lipidomics is not sample preparation or instrumentation but the human expertise required for data interpretation and analysis. We hope that projects like DeepLCMS encourage researchers to embrace novel resources and empower a broader audience to benefit from recent technological advancements."
